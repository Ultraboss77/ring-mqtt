        Before opening an issue, please search for all open and closed Github issues as well as any
        relevant discussion topics that may match your situation.
        
        Please **DO NOT** open bugs for simple howto usage questions or basic operational issues such
        as "I can't get the live stream to work". Such issues should be directed to the [discussion groups](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt/discussions) 
        instead.
        
        Please include the information requested in the fields below completely or the issue will
        likely be closed immediately.
        
        **Important note regarding camera support**    
        The ring-mqtt project does not turn Ring cameras into 24x7 CCTV cameras capable of continous
        streaming.  Ring cameras are designed to work with Ring cloud servers for on-demand streaming
        based on detected events (motion/ding) or for on-demand interactive viewing.  Even when using
        ring-mqtt, all streaming still goes through Ring cloud servers and is not local.  Using this
        project for continuous streaming is not a supported use case and attempts to do so will almost
        certainly end in disappointment.  Any support cases opened for issues with continuous streaming
         (i.e. more than one streaming session back-to-back) will be closed as unsupported.  This
         includes use with NVR tools like Frigate or motionEye.
